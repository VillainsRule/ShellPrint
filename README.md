<h2 align="center">what is shellprint?</h2>

shellprint is the "retaliation" built for Blue Wizard Digital's disablingof chat for guest users. i found this absolutely disgusting. msot users on chromebooks are fully unable to access the chat on their devices due to restrictions, meaning that the larger playerbase of Shell Shockers would be fully unable to use the chat. the chat can be used for strategies, encouragement, and obviously toxicity. the problem is, toxicity has a zero-tolerance policy in Shell Shockers and almost all of the toxicity said is caught by the hidden filter, so that chat tends to be very positive and just a light thing to enjoy. when cheaters started making chat spammers & trollers, this was hit with lashback by the normal players. they found these spammers & mockers downright annoying, since they could often say bad words with a simple filter bypass. Blue Wizard, in order to "fix" this problem, required accounts to be one day old or have a linked email in order to send messages. this is what i mentioned at the beginning here - this idea of restricted chatting. the cheating community freaked out, as well as some of the normal players who used Shell Shockers at school. Blue Wizard did NOTHING. instead, this policy was kept. in a few days, i built shellprint - the idea of free accounts for anyone with verified emails that could bypass the filter. i'm currently hoping Blue Wizard removes these, as this tool proves it really only makes life worse for chromebook players and cheaters were barely effected.

<h2 align="center">why build shellprint?</h2>

i consider myself more of an ethical hacker. often times, i warn people before making cheats and warn them again before publishing. sometimes, i outright give the solution - something that helps improve the security of online apps. however, if sites do not want to improve their security, i will publish these tools to prove such. when i built shellprint, i made sure Blue Wizard was aware of these tools and their potential. no response. i then upgraded them to be literally 10x faster. no response. at this point, i was getting very irritated. at that point, Blue Wizard removed chatting on guests entirely. no more one day old accounts being able to chat. this was a mistake. i decided to open-source this to prove that this only impacts the players who are not fortunate enough to be able to play Shell Shockers at home.

<h2 align="center">i am from Blue Wizard, and i hate this program!</h2>

i literally do not care. if you deeply want me to take this program down, open an issue or email me -- legal@villainsrule.xyz. we can chat about the future of the game and the apparent lack of security present.
